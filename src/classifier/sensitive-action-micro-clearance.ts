/**
 * The sensitive-action clearance MICRO-CALL — the precision half of the confirmation-line
 * design, hosted on its own dedicated call.
 *
 * Why a dedicated call: the observation was first parked on the big multi-task stage
 * classifier and failed its recall floor twice (the model, buried under ~3,600 tokens of
 * other instructions, cleared risky imperatives against its own verbatim counter-example).
 * The same model with this focused single-question prompt measured 45/45 on the frozen
 * labelled set. The measurement record lives with the acceptance runner.
 *
 * Timing contract (the whole point of this module's shape):
 *   - STARTED before the stage classifier's own call and never awaited by anyone.
 *     `read()` returns synchronously whatever has settled; the caller reads it after the
 *     classifier await it already performs. Added pipeline wall time: exactly zero.
 *   - `abort()` tears down a still-pending request at the join, so the hook process's
 *     event loop drains exactly as it does today (a pending socket would otherwise keep
 *     the process alive into the next hook's window).
 *   - Deterministically gated: no risky word in the prompt (the same keyword table the
 *     confirmation layer uses) ⇒ no call is started — a verdict would be unusable anyway,
 *     because a clearance only ever suppresses a keyword candidate.
 *   - ACCEPTED TRADE, stated rather than implied: the call starts BEFORE the popup decision
 *     exists (parallelism requires pre-start), so gated calls on risky-word prompts that end
 *     with no popup are spent without being consumed. That waste is bounded by the gate
 *     (~17% of prompts) and costed in the inventory row; serializing to avoid it would put
 *     the call's full latency on the pipeline, which is the worse trade by design.
 *   - Fail-closed totality: gate-out, no key, provider error, timeout, abort-before-settle,
 *     unparseable, malformed verdict, empty reason — every one of them reads as `undefined`
 *     (no clearance), and the confirmation line then emits exactly as it does today. The
 *     popup itself NEVER depends on this call: not its existence, not its other content.
 *
 * All failures are caught inside this module — an abandoned promise can never surface an
 * unhandled rejection, and the caller never needs a try/catch.
