 * (`stage-classifier.ts`): an injectable client (default `new OpenAI()`), the

 * `{ ok: false, reason }` result (TI-2 fix 2026-08-07) so the facade can map the
 * failure onto the runtime states that already exist, while `composePromptEnhancement
 * Body` still renders deterministically. Previously every failure collapsed to
 * `undefined`, making a provider timeout byte-identical to "never eligible for an
 * LLM call" in the UI, logs, and cost metadata simultaneously. This function never
 * throws to its caller.
 *
 * It only proposes wording. `composePromptEnhancementBody` independently validates
 * every draft (section id must be planned + non-original, no leaked ids/labels,
 * `sourceFactIds ⊆` the section's refs, `claim:` union) and rejects → deterministic
 * fallback, so a bad model reply is always safe.
