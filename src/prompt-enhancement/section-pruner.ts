/**
 * I2 — the deterministic pruner, under the LOCKED drop-criteria (§15.1).
 *
 * 🔒 The criteria are Hiren's, given 2026-08-16, and are not re-derived here:
 *   **(a)** evidence first, then relevance — an EMPTY section drops BEFORE ranking; the model's
 *           ordering ranks the remainder; the REGISTRY drops below-bar.
 *   **(b)** soft cap — the locked floor plus at most 2–3 extras.
 *   **(c)** slots follow their section, but no-invention state, send-policy and confirmation
 *           linkage stay on the body invisibly for the checks.
 *
 * 🔴 **What "empty" means was CORRECTED on 2026-08-20, by measuring a real body.** It used to mean
 * "no content-carrying fact", and stage (a) ran BEFORE the composer — so a section was judged on
 * facts it was never going to have, at a moment when the wording that would have filled it did not
 * exist yet. Only two section kinds have fact producers at all (`project_grounding_facts` and
 * `source_signal_guidance`); the other nine sockets in `SECTION_KIND_BY_ACTION` are wired and
 * unplugged. So "factless" did not mean "nothing to say" — it meant "not one of the two kinds
 * anything produces facts for".
 *
 * 🔑 Measured on the sim, same scenario, before and after this pruner first landed: a six-section
 * body carrying Approach, Acceptance and Verification — all three written from the developer's own
 * prompt, all three factless — became a three-section body. `context_and_constraints`, factless in
 * exactly the same way, survived only because the floor's "first required guidance" happened to
 * reach it first. Three good sections died and a fourth lived, on ordering luck.
 *
 * 🔒 Empty now means **no content-carrying fact AND no surviving composer draft**. A section the
 * model actually wrote has something to say, whether or not the registry had a fact for it.
 *
 * ⚠️ The evidence-before-relevance ORDER is untouched, which is what the criterion locks: whatever
 * is empty still drops before anything is ranked, and the ordering still cannot rescue it.
 *
 * ⛔ **The registry decides; the model only ordered** (prohibition 4). I1's observation is an input
 * to stage (b) and to nothing else: it cannot promote an empty section past stage (a), and it
 * cannot touch the floor at all. An empty or absent ordering is not "rank everything last" — it
 * means no relevance signal, and the cap then falls back to the planner's own order.
 *
 * 🔒 **The floor is UNTOUCHABLE** (prohibition 18, §15.1): the verbatim original, one required
 * guidance section, and safety when risky. Safety sections cannot be pruned, ever — §15.1's bound,
 * and §42.3's fatigue guard says the same thing about the same material.

 * exists to deliver, and a body without it has dropped the thing nexpath had to say.

/**
 * Criterion (b)'s cap: the floor, plus at most this many extras.
 *
 * 🔒 **LOWERED FROM 3 TO 2 — Hiren's ruling, 2026-08-20, superseding criterion (b)'s "2-3 extras".**
 * His words: *"too many sections are still considered as too much noise… so prefer bringing it down
 * to 4 on average. so the extra allowed which are 2-3 would become only 1-2."*
 *
 * 🔑 **Why the cap is the whole lever.** Measured on the frozen labelled set, every shown body had
 * at least 3 extras available, so bodies land on the cap rather than under it: the average body is
 * floor + cap, and floor measured ~3.25. That makes this constant, not the pruner's ranking, the
 * thing that decides body length.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Stated when the ruling was made, and chosen anyway:** cap 2 gives ~5.25 sections on average
 * rather than the ~4 named as the target; cap 1 would have given ~4.25. The owner took 2 with that
 * in front of him — recorded here so the gap between the target and the constant is not mistaken
 * later for an oversight.
 *
 * ⛔ An ALTERNATING cap (1, then 2, then 1…) was proposed and rejected: it makes the same prompt
 * produce different bodies depending on when it fired, and a directional action re-enters `prepare`,
 * so a section could appear inside a popup the user was already reading. §15.3 step 1 requires this
 * registry to prune DETERMINISTICALLY.
