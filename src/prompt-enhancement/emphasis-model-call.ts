/**
 * The optional model pass over a body that is already on screen.
 *
 * The popup never waits for this. It draws the full content with the rule-based marks at once,
 * this call is started beside it and never awaited, and whatever has settled is painted in when it
 * settles. Every way it can fail — no client, provider error, timeout, the popup closing, an
 * unparseable reply, a reply whose every phrase is discarded — comes out the same: the frame that
 * was already there, unchanged.
 *
 * ⛔ **There is no `new OpenAI()` fallback here, and that is deliberate.** The module this one is
 * shaped after has one, guarded by the reasoning "no key means it throws, so it is inert". That
 * holds on a terminal and does not hold everywhere this code runs: the browser service worker runs
 * the same engine with a key already published into its environment and a fetch shim that keeps
 * `new OpenAI()` working. Unguarded, every popup there would spend a billed call whose phrases
 * nothing can draw — that surface has no field for them. So a caller that passes neither a client
 * nor the explicit flag gets no call at all, and the test for that asserts the call is never
 * entered rather than that it failed.
 *
 * ⛔ **It never touches the store, and never changes the body.** What it returns is runtime-only,
 * marked as the model's, added to the rule-based list and never displacing one of them.
