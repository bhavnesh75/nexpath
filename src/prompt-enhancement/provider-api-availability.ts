/**
 * The provider-API availability check the runtime gate reads for evidence flag 10.
 *
 * `providerApiAvailabilityProven` (`provider_api_availability_pending`) attests one thing: an LLM call
 * can actually be made — the provider client resolves its key and constructs. Unlike the owner
 * approvals and the host-hold contract, this is inherently RUNTIME evidence: it is true only when the
 * key is present at call time, so the launcher derives it by calling this check, never by asserting a
 * static flag. The value tracks the environment, not a sign-off.
 *
 * The signal is exactly the one the batch composer already reads: constructing the client throws when
 * the key is missing, which the batch reports as `no_key`. This mirrors that construction so the gate
 * and the batch agree on when the provider is available, and takes an injectable constructor so the
 * check is testable without a real key.
