  // one we would accept" — a malformed or truncated token must be scrubbed too.

/**
 * Pad a marker with dots so it occupies exactly as many characters as the text it replaces.
 *
 * Redaction is the only step between the prompt as received and the copy that is stored, so
 * without this the stored copy is SHORTER — every secret shrinks it — and any character position
 * measured against the received prompt lands somewhere else in the stored one. Positions are how
 * the sequence planner records which part of a request each item covers, so a shifted copy makes
 * a stored range point at the wrong words, silently, and only on prompts that contained a secret.
 *
 * Dots rather than an invisible filler on purpose: a zero-width or non-breaking character would
 * keep the count while hiding that anything was removed, and it survives copy-paste, terminals,
 * editors and JSON far less predictably than ASCII does. A visibly long marker is the point — it
 * shows how much was taken out.
 *
 * Every marker in THIS module is shorter than its shortest possible match, so padding always
 * applies here. Other layers reuse this helper and some of their markers are longer than the
 * shortest thing they match — an email can be six characters and its marker is sixteen. There the
 * marker is returned unpadded and the text grows, because mangling the marker to hit a length
 * would be worse than the length being wrong. Only a layer whose markers all fit can promise the
 * property outright.
